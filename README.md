# Ml-tutorial-but-JS
The task to accompany the presentation 'Introduction to Machine Learning', a talk to be delivered to BAE about how to do supervised learning in code. Create a Neural Network from scratch in JavaScript, that is able to categorise a simple set of labelled data by calculating a boundary between the points.

## Getting started (10-15 minutes)
- Fork the repository, but try not to look at other people's forks unless you are collaborating with them!
- You will want to have some kind of Live Server extension on your VSCode or similar way of displaying index.html quickly when making changes, because we are doing this on a static site to hopefully make it a bit simpler for you.
- Look at index.html - you will notice that there are two script tags in the file. The top one is to load the external graphing module plotly.js, while the bottom one is to take in the logic that we need to plot our processed data.
- The plot.js is to turn data into lines on a graph. While most of the time you should just change the import file at the top depending on what you want to display, there may be helpful improvements to make further down the file too.
- Plot.js is expecting an object containing the data required to draw a scatter graph and a line, including the title, and axis labels. The example is from W3 Schools.
